What is Mongoose?
-------------------------------------------
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to define data structures, enforce validation, and interact with MongoDB databases in an organized and efficient way.

Why is Mongoose Used?
-------------------------------------------
Mongoose is used because it simplifies working with MongoDB by adding structure and helpful features like validation, middleware, and population.

Here’s why developers use Mongoose:

✅ Schema-based Modeling – Defines a clear structure for MongoDB documents.
✅ Validation – Ensures data consistency before storing it in the database.
✅ Middleware (Hooks) – Runs custom functions before or after database operations.
✅ Query Simplification – Provides powerful query-building methods.
✅ Relationships (Population) – Links documents from different collections.
✅ Timestamps & Defaults – Automatically manages creation and update times.
